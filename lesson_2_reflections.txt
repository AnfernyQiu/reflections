How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
the files in the staging area is ready to be commited but not now, and until commit the files can't be tracked by Git. whereas the files in repository can be tracked by Git. And the files in working directory are just nothing with Git but they can be moved to repository for tracked by some command.

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?
I think automatic merging has the benefit of saving time but sometimes Git could not judge whether there is a conflict or not. Always doing merge manually will take a lot of time and be unnecessary in some cases, but can handle all of the merge conficts.
