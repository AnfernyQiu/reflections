How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It's very helpful to find out the differences between two versions of a file, to locate the typo in the file and so forth.
And the command is easy to remember.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
I'm not sure so far. I'm just a beginner now.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Manually choosing when to create a commit let us know the commit meaning while having versions automatically saved can't.
But having versions automatically saved can saved automatically that would save all the versions that have difference and you can look the history conveniencely.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
If multiple files are related to each other, then allow saving multiple files in one commit is a good choise. Since we can see the diff between all of the related files rather than separate files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
Use git log to view the breif history of all files, then use git diff to see detail history of files versions.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
I'm very confident to make changes when I'm using version control since I can easily go back to any version at any time.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
I want to try using git for web develop, software develop and so on.
